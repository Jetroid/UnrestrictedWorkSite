# UnrestrictedWorkSite

Simple RimWorld mod that allows [work sites](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Work_site) to spawn at normal frequency so long as you have 1 or more colonists.
Normally the game does not spawn Work Sites when you have just one colonist, and spawns them at half frequency when you have two colonists.
This is useful if you're playing a solo-colonist run like [lone mechanitor](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Scenario_system#The_Mechanitor) with an [ideoligion](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Ideoligion) that has the Raider meme.

This is a simple Harmony Prefix patch that copies most of the functionality from the original function,
but skipping the checks that reduce or remove appearance frequency for low colonist counts
